Step 4: Network Manager
	We need to implement the basics of networking initally
	so all aspects of the project are integrated before
	additional complexity is added.
	
Step 5: Camera Manager
	We need a camera that can stay persistent while not
	loosing its set zoom, focus, position, or target. A Dynamic
	Camera that has the ability to shake, zoom, pan, and 
	smoothly follow. A camera that allows for pixel perfect
	rotations with smooth transitions is the goal.
	
Step 6: Menu Manager
	We need a robust menu manager that is easiy to add,
	and change according to the project needs. Being able to
	draw individual menus with both controller and mouse
	input.
